# Changes Impact Report

This document summarizes the significant changes implemented in the Attendance Management System (AMS) from Evolution 2 to Evolution 3 (final version). The updates focus on enhancing user experience and adding efficient, cheat-proof attendance verification mechanisms.

## Major Changes

### 1. Transition to GUI-Based Interface

- **Previous Version (Evol 2)**: The system utilized a text-based interface for all interactions, limiting user-friendliness and modern integration.
- **Current Version (Evol 3)**: The system has been upgraded to include a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI). This change improves user interaction, making the system more accessible and easier to use for individuals with minimal computer expertise.

### 2. Automated Attendance Verification

- **Previous Version (Evol 2)**: Attendance was recorded manually by instructors using a simple keypress for each student, which was prone to errors and potential dishonesty.
- **Current Version (Evol 3)**: Introduced an automatic attendance verification process where students within the classroom scan a real-time generated QR code. The system uses IP address verification to confirm the physical presence of students in the classroom, ensuring that attendance is both fast and secure.


### 3. GIS-Based Cheat-Proof Mechanism

- **Previous Version (Evol 2)**: The system had no mechanism to prevent proxy attendance or cheating.
- **Current Version (Evol 3)**: The system now incorporates a GIS-based cheat-proof mechanism using IP address checks to validate that students are physically present in the classroom when recording attendance. This feature enhances the integrity of the attendance data.


## Impact of Changes

These changes are expected to significantly enhance the usability and security of the AMS. By shifting to a GUI-based interface and incorporating automated, secure verification methods, the system now meets modern educational needs more effectively. The enhancements also aim to reduce the workload of faculty members and increase the accuracy of attendance records.

## Conclusion

The evolution from a text-based to a GUI-based system, coupled with the introduction of advanced security and verification technologies, represents a substantial improvement in the functionality and user experience of the AMS.
